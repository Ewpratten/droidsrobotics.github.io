Our team may be new to FIRST Robotics Competition, but it is not new to FIRST. Our team has a strong FIRST foundation. Most of our team members have been on FIRST LEGO League Teams for years. We deliberately also chose to have 1/3 of our team new to FIRST so that we could introduce the program to new students as well.

Our students come from two different school districts - one urban (Pittsburgh) and one rural (Sharon).

Pittsburgh was founded in 1794 and played a big role in the French and Indian War. (We like robots, but we like history too!) Pittsburgh was known for its steel industry. Today, it is known for robotics and many high-tech companies such as Google, Apple, Bosch, Facebook, Uber and major universities such as Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh.

Sharon was founded in 1795. It was a center for coal mining and then transitioned to steelmaking as a result of the Erie Extension Canal in the 1840s. We hope to make Sharon the center of robotics in 2020!
