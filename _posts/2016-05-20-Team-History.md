Not the Droids You are Looking For began in 2011 as a FIRST LEGO League team. The team won a Champion's Award and a Robot Performance Award every year of competing. Highlights include winning the Champion's Award at Razorback Invitational, Coach Award at World Festival and Champion's Award at World Festival.

2020 marks the next chapter of Not the Droids You Are Looking For. We are merging with alumni from two other award-winning FIRST LEGO League Teams - Tiger Techs Black and Tiger Techs Orange. The Tiger Techs have won the Champion's award in Western PA, and a Core Values award at both the North American Open and World Festival. Their Head Coach also won the Coach award at World Festival and is our team mentor.

Out team has two goals - to bring FIRST Robotics Competition to rural Pennsylvania and to spread STEM and FIRST globally.  To do this, we will include students never before exposed to FIRST and continue our global outreach efforts. Over the last decade in FIRST, we have mentored 1000s of teams, provided resources for 40,000 teams (over 400,000 users), taught workshops in four states and spread STEM at events reaching 100,000 visitors. We collaborate with teams worldwide to achieve our mission. Our goal is to be the Force For Change in FIRST Robotics Competition.
